# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the quality assurance strategy for validating three distinct system types: a web e-commerce application (Sauce Demo), public RESTful APIs (reqres.in, JSONPlaceholder, httpbin.org), and an agentic AI platform (ChatGPT-4). The strategy emphasizes risk-based testing, automation-first principles, and observable quality metrics to ensure rapid feedback and release confidence.

## 2. Scope & System Under Test

### 2.1 Web Application - Sauce Demo
**In Scope:**
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Product catalog browsing (filtering, sorting)
- Shopping cart operations (add, remove, update quantities)
- Checkout flow (user information, payment, confirmation)
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile viewports)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level A baseline)

**Out of Scope:**
- Payment gateway integration (stubbed in demo)
- User registration (demo uses predefined accounts)
- Backend database validation
- Third-party integrations

### 2.2 Public APIs
**In Scope:**
- **reqres.in**: User and resource CRUD operations, pagination, delayed responses
- **JSONPlaceholder**: Posts, comments, albums, todos, users API endpoints
- **httpbin.org**: HTTP methods, status codes, headers, authentication simulation, request/response inspection

**Out of Scope:**
- Rate limiting enforcement (will observe, not stress test)
- Long-term data persistence (ephemeral test data)
- Production-scale load testing

### 2.3 Agentic AI - ChatGPT-4
**In Scope:**
- Tool invocation and multi-step reasoning
- Structured data extraction (JSON schema adherence)
- Citation accuracy and source verification
- Safety guardrails (refusal of harmful requests)
- Instruction following with distractors
- Multi-turn conversation coherence
- Hallucination detection

**Out of Scope:**
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Latency SLAs (observational only)
- Multi-modal inputs (image, audio)

## 3. Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Areas
| System | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| Web | Authentication bypass | Critical - security breach | Negative testing, session validation, unauthorized access attempts |
| Web | Cart state loss on refresh | High - revenue impact | Persistence testing, local storage validation |
| API | Schema breaking changes | High - client failures | Contract testing, JSON schema validation |
| API | Pagination edge cases | Medium - incomplete data | Boundary testing (page 0, negative, beyond limit) |
| Agent | Citation hallucination | High - trust erosion | Source verification, ground truth comparison |
| Agent | Unsafe output | Critical - reputational damage | Jailbreak attempts, guardrail probing |

### Medium-Risk Areas
- Web: UI rendering inconsistencies across browsers
- API: Inconsistent error message formats
- Agent: Context window limits causing information loss

### Low-Risk Areas
- Web: Minor UI/UX polish issues
- API: Performance within acceptable bounds for public services
- Agent: Minor grammatical variations in responses

## 4. Test Types & Coverage

### 4.1 Functional Testing
**Objective:** Verify features work as specified

**Web:**
- Happy path: Login → Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout
- Alternate flows: Remove from cart, continue shopping
- Data validation: Form field constraints

**API:**
- CRUD operations for all resource types
- Query parameters (filters, pagination, sorting)
- Request/response payload validation

**Agent:**
- Single-turn task completion
- Multi-step workflows (research → extract → summarize)
- Schema-constrained outputs

**Acceptance Criteria:** 100% of critical user flows pass; 95% of secondary flows pass

### 4.2 Negative Testing
**Objective:** Validate error handling and input validation

**Web:**
- Invalid credentials (wrong username/password)
- SQL injection attempts in form fields
- XSS payloads in text inputs
- Unauthorized access (direct URL manipulation)

**API:**
- Missing required fields (400 Bad Request)
- Invalid resource IDs (404 Not Found)
- Malformed JSON payloads
- Unsupported HTTP methods (405)

**Agent:**
- Conflicting instructions
- Requests for harmful content
- Extreme edge cases (empty input, excessive length)

**Acceptance Criteria:** All invalid inputs rejected with appropriate error codes/messages; no crashes or exposures

### 4.3 Regression Testing
**Objective:** Ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes

**Approach:**
- Automated suite runs on every commit (CI/CD)
- Smoke tests (5 mins): Critical paths only
- Full regression (20 mins): All automated tests
- Selective regression: Based on code change analysis (impacted areas)

**Trigger Points:**
- Pre-merge: Smoke tests
- Post-merge to main: Full regression
- Pre-release: Full regression + exploratory

**Acceptance Criteria:** Zero regressions in critical paths; <2% acceptable flakiness rate

### 4.4 Performance Testing
**Objective:** Validate responsiveness and scalability within ethical limits

**Web:**
- Page load times <3s on 3G connection
- Time to Interactive (TTI) <5s
- Lighthouse performance score >80

**API:**
- Response time <500ms for GET requests (p95)
- Response time <1s for POST/PUT (p95)
- Graceful degradation under light load (1 RPS sustained)

**Agent:**
- First token latency <2s (informational)
- Full response <30s for complex queries (informational)

**Load Pattern:** Micro-benchmark only (1 RPS for 60s) to respect public service ToS

**Acceptance Criteria:** Performance within acceptable bounds; no errors under light load

### 4.5 Security & Safety Testing

**Web:**
- HTTPS enforcement
- Session management (timeout, logout)
- CSRF token validation (where applicable)
- Sensitive data masking (passwords)

**API:**
- Authentication header validation
- Authorization checks (can't access others' resources)
- SQL injection, XSS in API inputs
- Rate limiting headers inspection

**Agent:**
- Refusal of harmful requests (violence, illegal activity, PII exposure)
- Prompt injection resistance
- Bias detection in responses
- Hallucination detection (factual accuracy)

**Acceptance Criteria:** No security vulnerabilities identified; agent refuses all harmful prompts with explanation

### 4.6 Observability & Quality Metrics

**Test Execution Metrics:**
- Pass/Fail rate
- Test duration trends
- Flakiness rate (<2% target)
- Code coverage (>80% target for new code)

**Defect Metrics:**
- Defects by severity (P0-P4)
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Escaped defects (found in production)
- Defect resolution time

**Web Vitals:**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) <100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) <0.1

**API Health:**
- Availability (uptime %)
- Error rate (<1%)
- P50, P95, P99 latency

**Agent Quality:**
- Citation accuracy (% responses with valid sources)
- Refusal rate (for harmful prompts)
- JSON schema adherence (% valid outputs)
- User satisfaction proxy (task completion rate)

## 5. Test Environment Strategy

### 5.1 Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Refresh Cycle |
|-------------|---------|------|---------------|
| Local Dev | Developer testing, debugging | Synthetic/mocked | On-demand |
| CI/CD | Automated test execution | Ephemeral (created/destroyed per run) | Every commit |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | Production-like (anonymized) | Weekly |
| Production | Smoke tests only | Live data (read-only tests) | Post-deployment |

**Note:** For this portfolio, all tests run against public demo/free-tier services (local dev equivalent)

### 5.2 Test Data Strategy

**Web (Sauce Demo):**
- Use predefined accounts: `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`
- Tests are read-only or use session isolation
- No persistent state cleanup required (session-based)

**API (Public Services):**
- Create ephemeral test resources (POST)
- Use unique identifiers (UUIDs, timestamps)
- Clean up test data (DELETE) in teardown
- Fallback: Accept that data is transient on public APIs

**Agent:**
- Prompts are stateless (no persistent conversation memory relied upon)
- Use deterministic inputs for reproducibility
- Document expected outputs with tolerance for natural variation

### 5.3 Configuration Management
- Environment variables for base URLs, credentials
- `.env.example` templates (no secrets committed)
- Config files per environment (playwright.config.ts, pytest.ini)
